## Introduction

This little guide demonstrate how to turn any [Github](http://github.com) repository with a bunch of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files into a simple website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

* You don't need to use the command line or anything other than your browser.
* It doesn't require any knowledge in Jekyll.
* It's completely compatible with any bunch of markdown files you already have in any existing repository without any modification to those files.
* The markdown files will remain just as readable and usable in Github than in your website.

In fact you can consult this guide both in Github and in Github Pages, at your preference:

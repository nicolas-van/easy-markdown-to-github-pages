# Week 1

## Requirements Step

Working on the files:
- `Image processing algorithm`
- `MATLAB to Python conversion`   
Users and tokens are being loaded using the hardcoded code stored in users.json and tokens.json. Changing from loading from these json files to loading from tables (by executing sql query).


## Design/Build Step
- `Conversion of RGB to Gray scale`
- `Applying Adaptive binarization`
- `Applying Morphological operation`
- `Applying Watershed algorithm`
- `Segmentation of RBCs and WBCs`

## Testing Step
